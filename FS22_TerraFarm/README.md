## Downloading the mod

There seems to be a bit confusion on how you download the mod correctly.
Do not download a copy of the repository, please go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/scfmod/FS22_TerraFarm/releases) and download the latest version there :-)

## Note
Bugs can and will probably happen, so please keep that in mind when using this mod.

Mod is still a work in progress. Updated configurations for buckets and a guide will be provided when I get the time. If you encounter bugs or have suggestions/ideas please use the Issues section here on GitHub.

## Multiplayer
Multiplayer is supported, but is not guaranteed to work 100%.

There are currently no restrictions in place on where and who can terraform landscape in multiplayer.

## Vehicle/equipment support
Base game
- Albutt - Frontloader shovel
- Magsi - Telehandler shovel
- Magsi - Wheel loader shovel
- McCormick - Overtipping bucket
- Paladin - High dump bucket

Mods
- CASE CX250D long reach buckets
- CAT 990H bucket
- HAMM H11i road roller
- Liebherr R926 buckets

## Fill types
Mod now also supports several fill types which you can change in the settings GUI.
By default STONE and DIRT (will be added if not already exisiting).
You can also choose from additional fill types if added by 3rd. party mod/map:
- ASPHALT
- COAL
- TAILINGS
- CONCRETE
- LIMESTONE
- GRAVEL
- SAND
- IRON
- PAYDIRT
- RIVERSAND
- STONEPOWDER
- CLAY

~~When changing fill type make sure you empty the bucket first. Some types won't discharge as normal to the ground because of map setup. This will be fixed in next update!~~

NOTE: using other fillTypes than STONE in multiplayer won't work correctly. This issue will be fixed along with new network sync code in 0.4.0.0
